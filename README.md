# GCP GitLab Runner

This [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules creates a [GitLab CI runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/). 

The runners created by the module use preemptible instances by default for running the builds using the `docker+machine` executor.

- Shared cache in GCS with life cycle management to clear objects after x days.
- Runner agents registered automatically.

The runner supports 2 main scenarios:

### GitLab CI docker-machine runner 

In this scenario the runner agent is running on a GCP Compute Instance and runners are created by [docker machine](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/autoscale.html) using preemptible instances. Runners will scale automatically based on the configuration. The module creates a GCS cache by default, which is shared across runners (preemptible instances). 

### GitLab CI docker runner

In this scenario _not_ docker machine is used but docker to schedule the builds. Builds will run on the same compute instance as the agent. Auto scaling is supported via the `var.runners_max_replicas` and `var.runners_target_autoscale_cpu_utilization`. It uses Google Managed Instance Group Autoscaler to scale when the CPU usage of the instances move above `var.runners_target_autoscale_cpu_utilization`


> NOTE: If runners are set to use internal IPs, a Cloud NAT must be deployed for runners to be able to reach internet

### GitLab runner token configuration

The runner is registered on initial deployment. Each new runner registers itself with the same description and tag. To register the runner automatically set the variable `gitlab_runner_registration_config["registration_token"]`. This token value can be found in your GitLab project, group, or global settings. For a generic runner you can find the token in the admin section. By default the runner will be locked to the target project, not run untagged. Below is an example of the configuration map.

```hcl
gitlab_runner_registration_config = {
  registration_token = "Required: <registration token>"
  tag_list           = "Optional: <your tags, comma separated>"
  description        = "Optional: <some description>"
  locked_to_project  = "optional: true"
  run_untagged       = "Optional: false"
  maximum_timeout    = "Optional: 3600"
  access_level       = "Optional: <not_protected OR ref_protected, ref_protected runner will only run on pipelines triggered on protected branches. Defaults to not_protected>"
}
```

### GitLab runner cache

By default the module creates a a cache for the runner in Google Cloud Storage. Old objects are automatically removed via a configurable life cycle policy on the bucket.


## Usage


```hcl
module "runner" {
  source  = "DeimosCloud/gitlab-ci-runner/google"

  network = "default"
  region  = "europe-west1"
  project = local.project_id

  runners_name       = "docker-default"
  runners_gitlab_url = "https://gitlab.com"

  gitlab_runner_registration_config = {
    registration_token = "my-token"
    tag_list           = "docker"
  }

}
```

## Doc generation

Code formatting and documentation for variables and outputs is generated using [pre-commit-terraform hooks](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) which uses [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs).


And install `terraform-docs` with
```bash
go get github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs
```
or
```bash
brew install terraform-docs.
```
